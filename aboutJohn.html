  <p class="aboutText">John Cowan. A ray of sun in the never-ending storm. Your future head captain. A man of honor and respect. You would never find Mr. Cowan hosting a party during lockdown (R.I.P John's gaff (which was a hypothetical party that was discussed during a time when there was no restrictions on how many people can be in a house - John)). John has morals: a strict moral code that he shall never break. Under John, every pupil, no matter, shall receive the opportunity to approach him and bring forth suggestions to further improve the school he will be leading. <br><br></p>
